- Use if, else, else if statements to control logic flow
- Use a switch statement to control program flow
- Use a 'for' loop to iterate and execute a statement an arbitrary number of times
- Use a 'for' loop to iterate over an array and process its contents
- Use a 'while' loop to iterate until the state of the program changes
- Use a 'for..in' loop to iterate through the properties of an object
