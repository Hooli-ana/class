# OMDB Web App Mini-Lab

### PART I

Create a webapp that allows a user to search (hint: query 's') for a movie and display the top 5 movies with their title and poster using the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

With another AJAX request, display the movies' directors and titles. (hint: query 't')

### PART II

Once the movie is rendered from the OMDB API, create a button that says "More Info" under each movie displayed. When clicked, that button should query the [New York Times API](http://developer.nytimes.com/) to return a movie review with the title of the movie that was just searched.

You will need to sign up for an API key and it may take 20 minutes for your email so do that part first then plan the rest out!

### PART III

Bootstrap it up! Make your movie app look purttty and responsive :)
