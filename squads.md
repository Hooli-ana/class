# Squads

At the start of each unit in the course, we'll randomly match you with a few other students into a group. Think of your squad as your primary support group for that unit. 

Take advantage of your squad to: 

* Ask questions about homework
* Ask for feedback on homework or projects 
* Participate in pair programming/group activities during the unit 

Your squad is **not** the same as the group you'll have for the unit group project.
