# Office Hours

General office hours will be from **5:00-5:30pm**, Monday through Thursday. There will be no office hours during project weeks.

The format is informal: the instructors are "on duty" to help with homework or anything that you may have questions about in general from class.

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects!

## General Review

**Tuesday - 5:00pm to 6:00pm**

General Review sessions are a chance for you to receive extra help on topics that we already discussed in class. The topics can range from what we did in class that day to something from day one if required. The instructor will ask for topics that students wish to discuss and priortize what topics to go over for everyone. 

## Homework Feedback 

**Wednesday - 5:00pm to 6:00pm**

Homework Feedback sessions are a chance for you to have an instructor review your code from homework that you might be unsure of. Even if you were able to get something to work, you might be wondering if there was another way to accomplish the same task. This time will be focused on code that has already been written by students.
