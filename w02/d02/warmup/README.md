# Array Zipper

Using two existing arrays, create a new array that contains all of the items from array1 and array2 in a "zipped" like fashion.

**So for example**
``` Javascript
// Array 1
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

// Array 2
[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

// Array3 We create
[ 1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 3, 6, 3, 7, 2, 1 ]
```

**BONUS**
Can you make it so it works for two arrays of different sizes without "undefined" showing up in the new array?
